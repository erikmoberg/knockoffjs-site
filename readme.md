# KnockoffJS - The world needs another JS framework

KnockoffJS is a new type of framework, as it both embraces web standards when it fits, and other things when that turns out to be too hard. Also, instead of imagining a new, modern syntax, it (mostly) uses the binding syntax from Knockout, a framework that was popular around 2011. Go figure.

KnockoffJS was implemented with three values in mind: Embrace, Extend, and Extinguish.

## Embrace
Built completely on web standards, such as web components, to ensure future compatibility. Mostly.

## Extend
Adds features such reactivity and client-side routing and lets you focus on what matters: Messy business code.

## Extinguish
Superior to other popular frameworks in any conceivable way; start using it now or be left in the dust.
